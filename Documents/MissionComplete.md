```json
{
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "<your-secret-key>",
    "Issuer": "https://missioncomplete.com",
    "Audience": "https://missioncomplete.com"
  }
}
```

#### 3.3.3 Authentication Flow
1. User submits email and password to `/api/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in Authorization header for subsequent requests
4. Server validates token and authorizes requests based on user role

#### 3.3.3 Development Endpoints
The application includes development-only endpoints for initial setup:

- POST `/api/auth/dev/create-admin`
  - Creates an admin user with the specified email and password
  - Should be disabled in production
  - Example request:
    ```json
    {
      "email": "admin@example.com",
      "password": "secure_password"
    }
    ```
